# site-generating-script
mkdn.sh is a simple shell script to turn markdown documents into web pages. The script's prefatory comments offer simple instructions for its use. A sample page and css file are included here. Of course, you will need to install markdown for the script to work.

If you'd like a genuinely useful minimalist site generator, as opposed to the crappy one I threw together here, check out [Ultra Simple Site Maker](http://loup-vaillant.fr/projects/ussm/).
