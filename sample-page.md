# Markdown Experiment

I have always loved Carlos Fenollosa's [bashblog script][1], but since I do not need all the features associated with blogging, I thought I would try to create the most bare-bones, stripped-down script that would suffice for the simple static sites I create. Of course, I will need to refer to the [Markdown Syntax Documentation][2] frequently while I am editing.

Most of my sites include a page with a list of links to sites that I often visit:

[Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/)  
[Github](https://github.com/)

Although you cannot readily see the two spaces following the Daring Fireball link, those spaces are the markdown syntax to insert a br tag in the generated html page.
