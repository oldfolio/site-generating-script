# Markdown Experiment

Since I do not need all the features associated with blogging, I thought I would see if I could just create markdown files and then manually process them to create my web sites. Of course, I will need to refer to the [Markdown Syntax Documentation][1] frequently as I try to figure out what I am doing.

Most of my sites include a page with a list of links to sites that I often visit:

[Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/)
[Github](https://github.com/)
